# Linear Programming Solutions Using Pyomo

This repository contains solutions to 10 advanced linear programming problems (Series Number 36) using the Python-based optimization library **Pyomo**. 
The problems span across various domains such as production planning, advertising budget allocation, transportation, portfolio optimization, and agricultural product blending.


## ðŸ“¦ Contents

Each problem is implemented in its own Python script or notebook using Pyomo with clear constraints, objective functions, and interpretations of the results.
